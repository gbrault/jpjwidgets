# jpjwidgets
Jupyter Python+Javascript Widgets: link javascript variables with Kernel Python variables and vice-versa.

jpjwidgets is not a replacement<sup>1</sup> for ipywidgets, it is just a complement which fill some gaps and brings some 'innovations'

  * The most differentiating feature is that jpjwidgets brings a REST API, build by the application designer, embedded in the notebook
      * With the above feature, its possible to to fill the gap Jupyter Lab had (by design): communicate from javascript browser to the python kernel off-the-shelf
      * This HTTP communciation if completly safe as under the security framework of jupyter lab and using the jupyter server proxy
      * the notebook is at the same time
        * A Jupyter IPython notebook
        * A REST API (which can also serve some web pages or files if needed)
  * **Please use UI widgets from ipywidgets**: jpjwidgets project will not develop that (the range widget is just a POC)

## If you want

* to copy browser's javascript variables to IPython kernel variable
* to set some browser's variable based upon IPython kernel variable
* feed the notebook with pictures from your smartphone live (implementation not provided here)

## Examples

* get the current calling Notebook url in a python variable
* get the browser Geo Position (if the user accepts) in a Python variable

## Architecture

* Javascript is simply generated thanks to the _repr_javascript_ capability of IPython Notebook
   * this allows to set whatever javascript variable from a notebook programmatically
   * it can also be generated by the HTML function of IPython.display module
* Writing back javascript values to the notebook via the HTTP server
   * this allows to set whatever python IPython kernel variable with javascript Browser values
   * callback can also be implemented to change the state of the notebook when variable are received

## Install

* **Base Framework**: Jupyter Lab + Jupyter ipywidgets + Jupyter Server proxy
* **Copy**: notebook and python file in a Jupyter Lab directory
* create the widgets directory in the above
* **Run**: The notebooks

## Documentation

* Read the notebooks notes
* read the python file comments if you want to dig the HTTP server operations
